The `QtCore` module contains the core non-GUI functionality. This module is used for working with time, files and directories, various data types, streams, URLs, mime types, threads or processes. 

The `QtGui` contains classes for windowing system integration, event handling, 2D graphics, basic imaging, fonts and text. 

The `QtWidgets` module contains classes that provide a set of UI elements to create classic desktop-style user interfaces. 

The `QtMultimedia` contains classes to handle multimedia content and APIs to access camera and radio functionality.

The `QtBluetooth` module contains classes to scan for devices and connect and interact with them. 

The `QtNetwork` module contains the classes for network programming. These classes facilitate the coding of TCP/IP and UDP clients and servers by making the network programming easier and more portable. 

The `QtPositioning` contains classes to determine a position by using a variety of possible sources, including satellite, Wi-Fi, or a text file.

 The `Enginio` module implements the client-side library for accessing the Qt Cloud Services Managed Application Runtime. 

The `QtWebSockets` module contains classes that implement the WebSocket protocol. 

The `QtWebKit` contains classes for a web browser implementation based on the WebKit2 library. 

The `QtWebKitWidgets` contains classes for a WebKit1 based implementation of a web browser for use in `QtWidgets` based applications.

The `QtXml` contains classes for working with XML files. This module provides implementation for both SAX and DOM APIs. 

The `QtSvg` module provides classes for displaying the contents of SVG files. Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a language for describing two-dimensional graphics and graphical applications in XML.

 The `QtSql` module provides classes for working with databases. The `QtTest` contains functions that enable unit testing of PyQt5 applications.
